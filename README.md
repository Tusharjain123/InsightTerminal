 ## Insight Terminal <br/>
It is a terminal-based app to interact with the CLI. Currently, you can communicate with the AI model in your terminal and see the current time in your local time zone.<br/><br/><br/>
To communicate with the AI, you can write ```it chat --m "Your question" ```, to get the current timezone ```it timezone Timezone```. <br/><br/><br/>
